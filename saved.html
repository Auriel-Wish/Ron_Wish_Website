                                My CST training started when I met Ron and received a treatment from him. 
                                The gentleness, depth and speed with which he explored my body, mind, and soul formed the 
                                basis for the work I do today with both horses and humans. I've used CST to help hundreds 
                                of traumatized horses. Once I worked on a mare who, we were told, had had a stroke after surgery. 
                                She was standing with a heavy head, listing forward and to the left. I didn't dare work on her front end, so I
                                went to her tail and sacrum. By the time I finished she was standing normally, bright
                                eyed and able to eat her hay. She's been fine ever since. This work can truly be magical.

                                I just completed the Advanced Training in Craniosacral Therapy with Dr Wish at the Great River
                                Craniosacral Therapy Institute. Dr Wish is a kind, intuitive healer and a thorough, expert teacher. The
                                training was really practical, and I learned so much about how to use this wonderful healing modality
                                to help people. By receiving lots of Craniosacral Therapy during the training I developed a deep
                                internal sense of how Craniosacral Therapy works. With these gifts I'm sure I can open
                                a successful healing practice.

                                Ten years after completing the training program in Nyack, craniosacral therapy is still

                                and clinical social worker. My experiences at GRCTI were surprising, simple and profound, and 
                                I carry this knowing in my body, like a song. It is extremely rewarding every time the tools 
                                I gained through this training show up with the clients I listen to and touch. The results 
                                speak for themselves-in the tears, laughter and deep relaxing breaths of the many folks

                                My first treatment with Ron changed my life. It opened me to a whole new world of possibilities, 
                                and I had to learn more. CST training has helped me integrate my logical medical background as a 
                                physician's assistant with my intuitive and creative family legacy as a traditional curandera. 
                                Through my CST healing and training I not only live my life more authentically, but I can more 
                                fully hold open my heart space for other people's healing journeys. I totally recommend this 
                                training for medical practitioners and healers of all kinds-- to heal themselves and to better 
                                serve their patients on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels. I am deeply grateful 
                                to Ron for being an amazing teacher and practitioner who truly walks the talk.

                                My first treatment with Ron changed my life. It opened me to a whole new world of possibilities, 
                                and I had to learn more. CST training has helped me integrate my logical medical background as a 
                                physician's assistant with my intuitive and creative family legacy as a traditional curandera. 
                                Through my CST healing and training I not only live my life more authentically, but I can more 
                                fully hold open my heart space for other people's healing journeys. I totally recommend this 
                                training for medical practitioners and healers of all kinds-- to heal themselves and to better 
                                serve their patients on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels. I am deeply grateful 
                                to Ron for being an amazing teacher and practitioner who truly walks the talk.

                                Working closely with like-minded people in a safe environment allowed for profound inner 
                                processes to unfold and personal healing to occur. With Ron's tremendous gift of holding space, 
                                I was able to go deep within myself to face parts of me that I couldn't on my own. 
                                This has changed me and empowered me. I came in wishing to learn the craft of Craniosacral Therapy, 
                                but what I left with was much, much more than that. I left having a stronger sense of who I am 
                                and a new ability to be more open to the world around me, others, and myself.

                                I made lifelong friends and gained a beloved community.  I received and learned to facilitate healing sessions that 
                                seismically shifted old wounds. I gained access to my innate gifts both on and off the table through hands-on techniques, 
                                ritual, dialogue, group processing, and a deep sense of magic and wonder. I was guided back again and again to my 
                                intuition as I learned to trust my inner physician."

                                Dr. Ron Wish is the best group leader I have ever known. He has an amazing ability to create nets of safety while 
                                gently and kindly nudging participants to look into the mirror of their own perceptions—which melts open limiting 
                                stuck points the person never knew existed. It's a unique kind of Craniosacral Therapy/ Somato-Emotional Release 
                                work that is only effective because Ron is always willing to be vulnerable as he seeks personal growth for himself.

                        Ever since moving to the Hudson Valley in 1987, the great Hudson River has been a source of
                        inspiration and spiritual sustenance for me. Its waters are always moving, always changing,
                        whether calm or stormy, white capped or ice encrusted. They remind me of a pearl of wisdom
                        shared with me by Xerxes, a wise orthopedics resident, early in my family medicine training. He
                        was a Zoroastrian-- an ancient religion originating in Persia, whose devotees believe that
                        everything created is pure and should be treated with respect, including our natural world. In
                        teaching me how to do an orthopedic evaluation on a patient, he said,
                        <br><strong>“remember Ron, where there's movement there's life.”</strong><br>
                        No statement better reflects the essence of Craniosacral Therapy. At the GRCTI we continually
                        refine our abilities to listen to and follow the wavelike motion of the cerebrospinal fluid as it
                        reverberates throughout the body. We learn to help melt and relieve obstructions to this flow.
                        We support people of all backgrounds as we move through pain and trauma, and we celebrate
                        together in the joy and laughter that are our birthrights. Come join us!
