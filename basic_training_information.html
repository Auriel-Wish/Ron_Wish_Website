                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Our introductory course in Craniosacral Therapy is for you if you are looking for an exciting healing journey 
                    or a career-expanding adventure. This three-day workshop provides you with a practical and fun introduction to CST. 
                    In this training, you quickly begin using your healing hands in an altogether new way—with gentleness, intuition, 
                    and technical accuracy. You also begin connecting with the wavelike craniosacral rhythm and learn over 15 CST techniques 
                    that you can immediately put into practice to release structural and energetic blocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether CST is performed on its own or as an adjunct to your current practice—from surgery to spiritual healing—you 
                    and your clients will be awed by the results. For massage and physical therapists, rolfers, and chiropractors whose 
                    bodies are wearing out from hard manual labor, the gentleness of CST can transform and prolong your careers. For nurses, 
                    physicians, and psychotherapists seeking effective natural healing forms with virtually no negative side effects, 
                    this calm practice will rejuvenate you and deepen your patients' healing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The warm, supportive environment of our training program provides you with an ideal place to combine personal healing 
                    with a sacred inner journey. Come join us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goals of the introductory workshop are to give students a useful and practical introduction to CST, to 
                    teach students how to begin helping their patients release and resolve pain using CST, and to stimulate further 
                    interest in this hands-on healing modality.
                </p>
                <h3>Program Prerequisites</h3>
                <div id="first_list_basic">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Read: Your Inner Physician and You by John Upledger</li>
                        <li>Initial healing session with Dr. Wish (cost $350)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the initial healing session is both for me to get to know each student in a meaningful way and 
                    for each student to get a sense of me. This is not only a technical training, but also an intimate sacred healing 
                    journey, and we each need to decide whether or not to continue this intense journey together. Also, it is my 
                    responsibility to make sure that my students are safe as they touch one another physically, emotionally, 
                    and spiritually. I try to screen out anyone whose participation might be a detriment to themselves or others. 
                    This is a very alive training in which many students open to wondrous inner states they have never before accessed. 
                    Likewise students are exposed to levels of human suffering that they may have never before worked with. Getting to 
                    know each of you through our one on one session allows me to more fluidly guide and instruct the group in this 
                    miraculous healing art, as we develop your unique healing gifts and gently transform your wounds.

                <h3>Get to know Dr. Wish</h3>
                <p>
                    Dr. Ron Wish graduated from medical school at Case Western Reserve University in 1983 and completed his family medicine residency
                    at the University of Maryland Hospital in 1986. His mentors have included brilliant academics in urban medical centers in London, Tel Aviv, and Taipei, gifted 
                    Tai Chi teachers and traditional acupuncturists quietly practicing their arts nearby, beloved family physicians working 
                    with beautiful tribal people and displaced refugees in the mountains of southern India and northern Israel, and 
                    local shamans whose psycho-social and spiritual work seamlessly complemented their physician friends. There was an 
                    emergency room doctor in Portland, Maine who performed laying-on-of-hands healing on the sly; a Filipino cardiologist 
                    who ran his impoverished small town hospital with love; a traditional Tibetan doctor who shared his ancient healing 
                    system with Ron and asked for his help treating the tuberculosis epidemic in his refugee camp; and a Gazan internist 
                    who risked his life to get medical consults and free supplies from our mutual Israeli mentor.
